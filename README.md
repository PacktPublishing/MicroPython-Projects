This is the code repository for [MicroPython Projects ](https://www.packtpub.com/iot-hardware/micropython-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789958034), published by Packt.

**A do-it-yourself guide for embedded developers to build a range of applications using Python**

## What is this book about?
With the increasing complexity of embedded systems seen over the past few years, developers are looking for ways to manage them easily by solving problems without spending a lot of time on finding supported peripherals. MicroPython is an efficient and lean implementation of the Python 3 programming language, which is optimized to run on microcontrollers. MicroPython Projects will guide you in building and managing your embedded systems with ease.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Develop embedded systems using MicroPython 
* Build a custom debugging tool to visualize sensor data in real-time 
* Detect objects using machine learning and MicroPython 
* Discover how to minimize project costs and reduce development time 
* Get to grips with gesture operations and parsing gesture data 
* Learn how to customize and deploy the MicroPython kernel 
* Explore the techniques for scheduling application tasks and activities

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
# define LED color constants
LED_RED = 1
LED_GREEN = 2
LED_BLUE = 3
LED_YELLOW = 4
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are an embedded developer or hobbyist looking to build interesting projects using MicroPython, this book is for you. A basic understanding of electronics and Python is required while some MicroPython experience will be helpful.

## Errata
* Page 38 (paragraph 4,line 18-19 ), **...for installing the library that you can find at [github link]** the correct GitHub link is: https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async
* Page 27 - **Note: The example in the book is not using the ESP but the pyboard. For the pyboard, the pyb library does exist because it is for that board. Machine is a generic library designed to work across multiple targets.**
